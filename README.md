The pifm CODE here has been DEPRECATED in favor of using PiFmAdv

PiFmAdv can be found here - https://github.com/miegl/PiFmAdv

NOTE: I use a *modified* version of  PiFmAdv source code to NOT continually loop the audio on EOF. If you do not use my modified code, your APRS transmitter will JAM THE APRS RADIO FREQUENCY!

The source code to my modified PiFmAdv can be found here - https://github.com/ka9cql/warpig13_Redux/tree/main/home/PiFmAdv/src

My complete code/script repository that uses PiFmAdv to send APRS over a Raspberry Pi Zero W GPIO pin can be found here - https://github.com/ka9cql/warpig13_Redux
