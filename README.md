THIS CODE HAD BEEN DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF THE PiFmAdv PROJECT

PiFmAdv can be found here - https://github.com/miegl/PiFmAdv

NOTE: I use a *modified* version of  PiFmAdv source code to NOT continually loop the audio on EOF. If you do not use my modified code, your APRS transmitter will JAM THE APRS RADIO FREQUENCY!

My new repository using this PiFmAdv can be found here - https://github.com/ka9cql/warpig13_Redux

The files (my mods) to PiFmAdv can be found here - https://github.com/ka9cql/warpig13_Redux/tree/main/home/PiFmAdv/src
